DefaultSort
===========

This plugin can be used to override the Omeka default sorting when browsing a collection or items, which is set to `date added`. You can set it to any metadata element and also select the direction of the initial sort.

#### Please note

In most cases you will want to add whichever option you select in the plugin to the list of sort links in your browse views. Take a look at the Omeka default theme for an example.

`/Omekaroot/themes/default/items/browse`

Thanks to @patrickmj from the Omeka Dev Team for the basic filter implementation.
